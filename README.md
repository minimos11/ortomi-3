<h1>this project is about extracting the source code out of a esp flaser.exe</h1>
That flashes a ESP8266EX chip with custom firmware but I want to modify the firmware.<br>
So I can add new features. <br>
The source code for the firmware is ether just python or micropython. <br>
I have already extracted the exe and got the firmwar.bin. <br>
